This is a grails plugin for the NSL project that maps the Domain objects of NSL. It is used to generate and update the
schema for the NSL.

## Considerations

When making schema changes we have to consider two cases:

- creating the schema for a new database
- modifying the schema in an existing database

and this means your changes need to appear in an update script and the nsl-ddl.sql file.
 
## Where to make your changes.

### Adding/Changing a view, trigger, index or default data 

If you are adding a view, trigger, index or default data:
 1. first add your changes to an appropriate file in the `/web-app/sql/views` directory
 1. run `grails generate-nsl-ddl` to regenerate the nsl-ddl.sql file with your changes included
 1. Add your change to the latest `update-to-nn.sql` file in the `/web-app/sql` directory

Remember the update-to-nn script is updating a database from the previous version, so you must take into account existing
views and **not loose data**.

### Adding or changing tables (domain objects)

If you are changing a table or tables you **must** make those changes in the Grails domain classes which will 
generate the appropriate sql when the `grails generate-nsl-ddl` command is run. This keeps the grails domain
classes,sql and DB schema in sync.

 1. make your changes to the grails domain classes in `/grails-app/domain/au/org/biodiversity/nsl`
 1. preferably test your changes using `grails maven install` locally
 1. run `grails generate-nsl-ddl` to regenerate the nsl-ddl.sql file with your changes included
 1. diff nsl-ddl.sql to extract changes to put into the latest `update-to-nn.sql` file in the `/web-app/sql` directory

## What version number

Make sure the version number you are working on is **not the currently released version**, if necessary create a new
version and update the default version number in `sql/views/other-setup.sql` as well as 
`grails-app/services/au/org/biodiversity/nsl/NslDomainService.groovy`.

##Notes

The simplest way to make the update sql is the re-generate the DDL from grails using the script:

`grails generate-nsl-ddl`

and `diff` the result to see what needs to be changed.

When starting off with a fresh NSL shard it's probably best to execute the nsl-ddl.sql file against your database 
(traditionally called nsl).

When writing `update-to-nn.sql` scripts we **try to make the update script idempotent**, so that if it is run twice (either 
deliberately or accidentaly) it results in the same thing. Note data loss is possible it the scripts are run again after 
a while.
